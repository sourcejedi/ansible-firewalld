<!--
firewalld defaults to <zone target="%%REJECT%%">.

The argument for using target="DROP" (and also drop ICMP echo) is to
slow down network reconnaisance, if your organisation is targeted by a
skilled attacker.

For my usage:
1. This argument is not a priority.
2. It is useful to run "ping".

I discount arguments such as Gibson's that this was useful for personal
dialup connections.  Either the attacker has an exploit that works on
one of your open ports, or they don't.

I will consider pull requests if the implementation is clearly
justified in comments, and the README text adds minimal overhead.

("Enable this option if your organization's policy requires dropping
ICMP ping probes, and probes of firewalled ports, without a response.
If you are not sure, leave it disabled.  You could need to use such
probes for troubleshooting, or to prevent IP address conflicts (ping
from DHCP server), or for certain protocols (IPv6 Teredo?).
Responding to probes of firewalled ports can also avoid waiting for a
long timeout.)
